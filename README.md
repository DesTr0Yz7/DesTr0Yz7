## Hello there 

My username is DesTr0Yz7. *Please don't mind the capitals and numbers, I used the name ever since I was a kid during the Xbox 360 days lol.*

I'm currently doing a college course in video games and digital media design.

I am *also* doing some modelling and animation work for a modded Minecraft server called Cobbleland, where I'm currently learning how to create datapacks and resource packs.

Fun fact: I am 100 meters from your location, and approaching rapidly.
## *Start running*
